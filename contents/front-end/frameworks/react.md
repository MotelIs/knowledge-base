# React

## Summary
Smart-updating view layer for user interfaces, supported by Facebook

## Official Documentation
* https://facebook.github.io/react/

## Pros
* Most popular current framework in the industry
* Supported by Facebook
* Simple, component-based architecture

## Cons
* Simple API leads to many different implementations
* Typically requires a large ecosystem of libraries to make work (Redux, webpack, ES6, etc)

## Why should/shouldn't we use this?
Due to the high client demand for this library, and the large amount of developers with knowledge in it, I think this is a must-have. The component-based architecture allows us to easily organize our applications, and write reusable components.

Also, React can be used for native apps, via [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
