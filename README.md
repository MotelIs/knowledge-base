# Motel Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Motel Knowledge Base! This repo is a list of the tools and technologies we, as Motel engineers, commit to maintaining proficiency in, and a place to store learning resources.

## Process
* To add an item for evaluation, open a PR and get at least one approval
* Once item is approved, copy [item template](./templates/item) into new markdown file
* Once item has been evaluated and the template completed, open a PR and the item will be discussed during weekly Dev Team meeting
## Key
* Items in **bold** are things that we have committed to the Knowledge Base.
* Items in regular text are items that are currently being researched.
* Items in ~~strikethrough~~ are items we have researched and we have decided we are uninterested in.
